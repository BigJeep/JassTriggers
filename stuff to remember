 - create the least amount of (global?) groups and reuse them instead of creating new temp groups
 - the same thing could be said about units and other leaking handles maybe?
 - a single trigger that creates the triggers for all other spells
 - a single trigger that initializes all hashtables and other crap that must be initialized
 - a trigger that makes dispel effects dispel other spell buffs from trigger spells that wouldnt be able to be dispelled normally (auras etc.)

 - create all periodic functions inside their own spell triggers/files whatever, but make it so they are all fired from a single periodic trigger at the very end
