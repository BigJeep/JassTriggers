/* It works properly whenever the hero dies with reincarnation on cooldown,
but doesn't work when Reincarnation is actually taking effect, as it doesn't
count as the unit dying.
Apparently there is no way of detecting reincarnation activation per se, but
the reincarnating unit counts as dead while it doesn't come back to life, so
a periodic check of it being dead (with Reincarnation entering cooldown hope-
fully) is the first step to detect the reincarnation process
I could come up with something else, but most effects I would like require
a trigger to detect the hero reincarnating so there isn't much choice here
