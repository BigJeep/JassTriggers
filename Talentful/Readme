  - Naval stuff

For now I'll just call it "Talentful", as in Talentful Armies, Talenful Heroes... talent something something, still undecided


////////////////////////////////////////////
Heroes
  Heroes start with all their 3 main skills already learned at level 1, and are automatically leveled up at levels 4 and 8
  Level 1 abilities also cost less mana than vanilla to make up for "forcing" the player to have all three at once
  
  The "Hero Abilities" is now a "Talent Tree" button, opening it will show 3 talents for each ability, and two ultimate abilities in the 4th column
  Something like this:
  
  A1  | B1  | C1  | D1
  A2  | B2  | C2  | E1
  A3  | B3  | C3  |
  
  letters are different abilities, and numbers its "tier" or power level or whatever
  
  Picking a talent consumes a hero skill point and grants a new effect, described in its tooltip, for an ability.
  Talents in the first row are available at level 1, the ones in the second row are available at level 3, and the ones in the last at level 5
  Talents in the second and third row also levels up the respective ability
  
  The player can choose only one of the two available ultimates, one being the vanilla one, and the other being a new one made by me
  The vanilla ultimate will also come with a "Talent", that is, a new effect bound to the ability so that it has as much novelty appeal as a new ultimate
  Some new ultimates might intentionally have a lower power level than the vanilla + talent one, which I will make up for it allowing it to be learned at level 5 intead of 6
  
  Tome of Retraining can be used to unlean all talents, refund spent skill points and revert abilities level back.
  HOWEVER, while the ultimate might be unlearned, the other won't become available again. Picking an ultimate makes the hero bound to it for that match.
  
  At the end of this file, I will write down the talents and ultimates I already came up with

New Units
  Human
    Markswoman: Same as IPRS, a light ranged unit trained at Arcane Santum, which is now available at tier 1 (without the other units).
                Can Alternate between magic type attacks and piercing type attacks that deal additional damage to magic immune enemies.
                NEW: It might have a new ability, Lightmeld, unlocked at Tier 3 or something, which hides nearby allies and reveals enemies.
    Ram Rider: Same as IPRS, trained at Barracks at tier 2, weaker than Knight but with a powerful knockback on its attacks and siege type damage.
    Dynamiter: A truly new unit, a Gnome Rogue trained at Workshop. The idea is make it particularly effective against workers and armored target, and also buildings of course.
               Can become invisible, either with reduced movement speed or idk you must pay gold for it
  Orc
    Warlock: Same as IPRS, a powerful tier 3 caster trained at the Spirit Lodge, dealing damage to the building after this process!
             Can't attack nor regenerate mana, but has heavy armor, a big health pool and resistant skin. Regenerates mana by dealing damage to itself through Life Tap.
             Has Fear, which causes an unit to run scared from the Warlock; Demonic Circle, which creates a stationary unit that can teleport allies to itself (but damaging them),
             and Demonology, which either spends its mana to summon a personal demon to attack an enemy, or spends its mana AND health in an attempt to take control of another demon
    Ogre:    New unit as well (as in it is not in IPRS), or should I say two units in one! Inspired in Cho'Gall, Ogres are super strong tier 3 units trained at Barracks.
             Selecting the unit selects two, with the second one (the other head) being an, I don't know, abstract unit? Anyway, both heads share the same mana pool, and
             have different abilities. Unsure about its abilities so far, but the ones I sorta planned already are Eye of Kilrogg, a locust unit with true sight that 
             roams an area around the Ogre; a Magic Immune for this unit that must be activated by the second head; and some sort of synergy/interaction with other high
             food cost units, such as Taurens (which would probably get shafted as orcs get another costly unit)
  
  Undead
    Val'kyr Twins: A powerful unit, maybe trained in the Boneyard, but a player can have only two at once.
