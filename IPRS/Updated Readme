Another readme for good measure, with the most updated info I can remember.
WIP doesn't necessarily means I started


HEROES
  HUMAN
    ARCHMAGE
      Brilliance Aura: Make it so whenever someone targets him with a spell, it some mana is either refunded or burnt for allies and enemies respectively
    PALADIN
      Done
    MOUNTAIN KING
      Avatard Dwarves still bugged
    BLOOD MAGE
      Flame Strike: nothing yet
      Banish idea: Causes the unit to restore/drain mana from other nearby units, then explode at the end depending on how much mana was stolen
      Siphon Mana iirc is fine and done already
      Phoenix WIP, mana spent or drained by the hero heals the phoenix, and increases the hp of the next egg

  ORC
    BLADEMASTER
      no idea
    FAR SEER
      Chain Lightning requires something new, and will probably require being recreated via triggers
      Feral Spirit is finished, but I'm planning on doing something new, such as just making them, upon death, repeat the last spell the Far Seer casted, before being summoned, including another feral spirit.
    SHADOW HUNTER
      Healing Wave is done
      Hex still WIP and must be finished before the map is published for the first time
      Serpent Ward no idea
      BBV WIP Wards repeat the spell
    TAUREN CHIEFTAIN
      Shockwave is done
      War Stomp must be reworked in order to add a interval between each repeated stomp
      Endurance Aura WIP Mortal Strike thing
      Reincarnation WIP leaving ghost behind thing, will probably require a lot of testing

      Death and Decay WIP no idea

  NIGHT ELF
    DEMON HUNTER
      Mana Burn WIP Silences and Magic Devours if target's mana is above 1/2. If immolation is active, bounces to an additional target by immolation level
      Immolation WIP Every n seconds, causes the next Immolation activation to cast Chaos Nova, which slows enemies next to the DH, or stuns if he is morphed. Does something every n damaged caused while active
      Evasion WIP can now be activated to give DH an evasion aura for a minute or so
      Metamorphosis WIP passively leeches and randomly fears demons. Want to add something else

    KEEPER OF THE GROVE
