I sometimes make commits with JASS scripts that I'm going to use in my maps.

Currently, I am reworking a map of mine called "Invasion Point: Raging Stream" from the ground up, since the actual version of it left a lot to be desired
Once it is done, I'm planning on creating an Altered Melee map pack called "Nameless Expansion" due to a lack of creativity for names, but hey, this one sounds like a good name so I might leave it like this.
