Altered Melee Map
  - Hots-like Talent System for heroes
  - New Units for each race
  - New abilities and upgrades for existing units
  - Naval stuff
  - Dynamic Starting Points
  - Colored Items

For now I'll just call it "Talentful", as in Talentful Armies, Talenful Heroes... talent something something, still undecided

I don't want player to having to re-learn how to play a melee match for a single map, therefore all additions are just that, additions, without interfering on the players'
core strategy if they're willing to only play like that, allowing them to just reap the benefit of added bonuses, without preventing them to get out of their way to make use of 
new stuff to give them the edge

Inspirations for new stuff, such as units, abilities, techs, name, etc. obviously came from blizzard's many games, but I would also like to point out that many are
also from early development stuff that got cut and helped me a ton to come up with cool new ideas

////////////////////////////////////////////
Heroes
  Heroes start with all their 3 main skills already learned at level 1, and are automatically leveled up at levels 4 and 8
  Level 1 abilities also cost less mana than vanilla to make up for "forcing" the player to have all three at once
  
  The "Hero Abilities" is now a "Talent Tree" button, opening it will show 3 talents for each ability, and two ultimate abilities in the 4th column
  Something like this:
  
  A1  | B1  | C1  | D1
  A2  | B2  | C2  | E1
  A3  | B3  | C3  |
  
  letters are different abilities, and numbers its "tier" or power level or whatever
  
  Picking a talent consumes a hero skill point and grants a new effect, described in its tooltip, for an ability.
  Talents in the first row are available at level 1, the ones in the second row are available at level 3, and the ones in the last at level 5
  Talents in the second and third row also levels up the respective ability
  
  The player can choose only one of the two available ultimates, one being the vanilla one, and the other being a new one made by me
  The vanilla ultimate will also come with a "Talent", that is, a new effect bound to the ability so that it has as much novelty appeal as a new ultimate
  Some new ultimates might intentionally have a lower power level than the vanilla + talent one, which I will make up for it allowing it to be learned at level 5 intead of 6
  
  Tome of Retraining can be used to unlean all talents, refund spent skill points and revert abilities level back.
  HOWEVER, while the ultimate might be unlearned, the other won't become available again. Picking an ultimate makes the hero bound to it for that match.
  
  At the end of this file, I will write down the talents and ultimates I already came up with
  
////////////////////////////////////////////
New Units
  HU
    Markswoman: Same as IPRS, a light ranged unit trained at Arcane Santum, which is now available at tier 1 (without the other units).
                Can Alternate between magic type attacks and piercing type attacks that deal additional damage to magic immune enemies.
                NEW: It might have a new ability, Lightmeld, unlocked at Tier 3 or something, which hides nearby allies and reveals enemies.
    Ram Rider: Same as IPRS, trained at Barracks at tier 2, weaker than Knight but with a powerful knockback on its attacks and siege type damage.
    Dynamiter: A truly new unit, a Gnome Rogue trained at Workshop. The idea is make it particularly effective against workers and armored target, and also buildings of course.
               Can become invisible, either with reduced movement speed or idk you must pay gold for it
  Orc
    Warlock: Same as IPRS, a powerful tier 3 caster trained at the Spirit Lodge, dealing damage to the building after this process!
             Can't attack nor regenerate mana, but has heavy armor, a big health pool and resistant skin. Regenerates mana by dealing damage to itself through Life Tap.
             Has Fear, which causes an unit to run scared from the Warlock; Demonic Circle, which creates a stationary unit that can teleport allies to itself (but damaging them),
             and Demonology, which either spends its mana to summon a personal demon to attack an enemy, or spends its mana AND health in an attempt to take control of another demon
    Ogre:    New unit as well (as in it is not in IPRS), or should I say two units in one! Inspired in Cho'Gall, Ogres are super strong tier 3 units trained at Barracks.
             Selecting the unit selects two, with the second one (the other head) being an, I don't know, abstract unit? Anyway, both heads share the same mana pool, and
             have different abilities. Unsure about its abilities so far, but the ones I sorta planned already are Eye of Kilrogg, a locust unit with true sight that 
             roams an area around the Ogre; a Magic Immune for this unit that must be activated by the second head; and some sort of synergy/interaction with other high
             food cost units, such as Taurens (which would probably get shafted as orcs get another costly unit)
  
  UD
    Val'kyr Twins: A powerful flying caster that can also land, maybe trained in the Boneyard, but a player can have only two at once.

////////////////////////////////////////////
Techs
  Most, if not all, will have NO RESOURCE COST, but may have some lengthy research durations
  
  HU
    Flare: Available at Barracks, now also allows Riflemen to use at with limited range
    Demolition Squad: Upgrade that allows Mortar Team and Dynamiters to Self-destruct, dealing heavy damage. After a short interval the sacrificed unit will be revived at its owner base
    Steam Engine morph: Allows Steam Engines to upgrade into its beta Wrecking Ball version, permanently making it a melee unit, but able to carry units inside. Riflemen can shoot from within and peasants can repair.
  Orc
    A nameless ability rather than an upgrade: Spirit Lodges can toggle how much health will be sacrificed upon training Warlocks, granting them additional mana while the higher hit point sacrifice is enabled
    Upgrade that allows Ogres to be trained at Altar!
    Tauren renamed to Tauren Bulls, and Pulverize comes researched already
  UD
    Dirt Eater: Cannibalize comes researched already, and researching Dirt Eater makes dying ghouls to summon a Dirt Eater, a sick/poisonous ghoul with lifespan increased according to how much the dying ghoul cannibalized
    Ability that allows Ghouls and other crap to "fuse" into an Abomination
    Corpse Explosion: Abomination Self-destruct, empowered by how much it cannibalized while alive
    Psychic Scream: Upgrade that causes Banshees to scream upon death, scaring enemies and making them run away from the point where they die
    Greater Summon Building: Undecided whether I'm giving Necromancers this shit or not. The idea is give the Necromancers their early development purpose, being the
                             actual builder of the faction, also allowing me to make use of cool structures I can't fit anywhere else such as Gargoyle Spire
    Necromancer ghost as an alternative unit for Greater Summon Building
    Spire: Gargoyles and Carrion Birds
    Tree of Woe: ??? something to do with Cold Wraiths?
    Heunting (a building I guess): ???
  NE
    Mark of the Wild: Same as IPRS, Huntress Hall upgrade that unlocks a new beast form for druids. Both drain mana while morph
    Moonkin Form: Druid of the Talon new morph with strong magic attacks that gain different buffs at day and night
    Cat Form: Druid of the Claw new morph with permanent invisibility, can pounce at targets and deal damage based on their maximum hit points

Naval
  
  NON-SHIPS
  Some race units are now amphibious, more for the flavour rather than balance:
    Sorceress
    Ethereal Spirit Walker
    Shade
    Mounaint Giant (I will need a new model)
  Some heroes are now amphibious as well. Any hero other than Sea Witch gets a movement penalty:
    Death Knight and Lich (only if I can make a water freezing visual effect)
    Demon Hunter?
    Sea Witch
    Pit Lord (will require a new model)
    
  SHIPS AND SHIPYARDS
  Invulnerable Neutral Goblin Shipyards are spread across the water, with Goblin Sloops for hire. 
  However, these also "sell" upgrades to itself into player-owned, vulnerable shipyard building for each race.
  Each race shipyard allows training unique ships, while also allowing allies to hire transport ships. Destroying a shipyard reverts it back to a neutral Goblin Shipyard instead 
  
  I might just change the names to generic ones such as "Transport Ship" and "Battleship"
  
  HU
    Caravel: Less gold than Goblin Sloops
    Frigate: a bit faster
    Galleon: can fire at all directions and spreads its damage (divides among targets, a single target will be toast)
    Submarine: Scout
  
  Orc
    Transport Ship: Less wood than Goblin Sloops
    Destroyer: a bit more resistant
    Juggernaut: 
    War Zeppelin:
  
  UD
    Sky Barge
    Corvette
    Dreadnought
    Ghost Ship

  NE
    Schooner
    some other ship name I'm forgetting
    Brigantine
    Water Ancient or Turtle Ancient
